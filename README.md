London borough wise jobs and job density visualisation  - link to visualisation -  https://arunkoshy07.github.io/LondonJobDataVisualisation.github.io/


This visualisation shows the variations in jobs and job density in London Boroughs from 2000 to 2017. The source of data set is https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/jobs-and-job-density-borough . This visualisation will potentially shows the places worth investing in and could be leveraged for future housing and infra developments. 
The height of polygons is used to show the no of jobs and color gradient is used to show the job density. It has a slider bar on the top left to show the temporal variation of job and job density data. There is also animate button to rotate the map to give you a 3d effect. It also has the zoom and reset bearing buttons on the right. 
I have used the Mapboxgl api to show the map and data. P5 framework was used to add features to change the geojson features, animation and wrap the whole as a package.
